### What You Can Do Once You're In

**Book Kitchen Time**
Log in and head to the **Calendar** to reserve your station. Bookings are checked for conflicts in real time — if a slot is open, it's yours.

**Clock In at the Kiosk**
When you arrive, use the iPad kiosk at the facility entrance to clock in with your PIN. You'll set your PIN under **Settings → Security** after account setup.

**View Your Billing**
All your invoices are available under **Billing → My Invoices**. You can view the status of each invoice (draft, open, paid) and see a full line-item breakdown. If you have questions about a charge, reply to this email or use the contact form.

**Submit Maintenance Requests**
If you notice a problem with any equipment — ovens, hoods, refrigeration, anything — report it through **Maintenance → Report an Issue**. Our team tracks every ticket and will follow up on the status directly.

**Manage Your Profile**
Update your contact info, company name, and notification preferences anytime under **Settings**.

If you have any questions before your first session, don't hesitate to reach out.
