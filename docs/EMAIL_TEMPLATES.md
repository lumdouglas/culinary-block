Log in and head to the **Calendar** to reserve your station. Bookings are checked for conflicts in real time — if a slot is open, it's yours.

**Clock In at the Kiosk**
When you arrive, use the iPad kiosk at the facility entrance to clock in with your PIN. You'll set your PIN under **Settings → Security** after account setup.

All your invoices are available under **Billing → My Invoices**. You can view the status of each invoice (draft, open, paid) and see a full line-item breakdown. If you have questions about a charge, reply to this email or use the contact form.

**Submit Maintenance Requests**
If you notice a problem with any equipment — ovens, hoods, refrigeration, anything — report it through **Maintenance → Report an Issue**. Our team tracks every ticket and will follow up on the status directly.

## 2. New Timesheet System Announcement

**Subject:** New Timesheet System Starting March 1

---

Hi [First Name],

We're rolling out a new timesheet system starting March 1 to make tracking your kitchen hours faster and more accurate.

### How it works

A kiosk tablet will be mounted at the kitchen entrance. When you arrive and when you leave, you'll use it to clock in and out — no more manual logging.

1. Select your name from the screen
2. Enter your 4-digit PIN
3. That's it — your session is recorded automatically

### Setting up your PIN

Before March 1, please log into your tenant portal and go to **Settings → Security** to set your kiosk PIN. You'll need this to use the kiosk, so make sure to do this before your first shift.

### Viewing your hours

You can see all your clock-in/out records anytime under the **Timesheets** tab in your portal. If you notice an error in a record, you can submit an edit request directly from that page and we'll review it promptly.

### Your billing and invoices

All your invoices are available under the **Billing** tab in your portal. You can view the status of each invoice, see a full line-item breakdown of your charges, and keep a record of your payment history — all in one place. If you ever have a question about a charge, reply to this email or use the contact form in your portal.

### Reporting equipment issues

If you notice a problem with any equipment while you're in — ovens, hoods, refrigeration, anything — please report it through the **Maintenance** tab. Submit a quick description of the issue and our team will be notified right away. You can track the status of any ticket you've submitted from the same page.

### Questions?

Reply to this email or use the contact form in your portal. We'll also have someone available at the kitchen on March 1 if you need help getting set up.

Thanks for being part of Culinary Block — we think this will make things a lot smoother for everyone.
