Project Rules:
- We use Next.js 16 (App Router) and Turbopack.
- Validations are in @/lib/validations.
- Database logic is in @/app/actions.
- Always export inferred Zod types as 'XFormValues'.
- When handling HTML datetime-local inputs, always use a helper to convert between JS Date and ISO String.
- UI components use Shadcn; if a variant like 'success' is missing, add it to the component's CVA definition.
